# What's this about?
ArcticFox is a project I made for my Rich Media II class.
I created an API to GET, POST, PUT, and HEAD data from a node server I created.

The front end is used to store locations that you want to save for later.
The data will only be saved for roughly 30 minutes due to the data being hosted on the server itself.

Because it's hosted on Heroku, and they restart the server every ~30 minutes or so, any data added will
be lost.

There is some test data already on there to quickly view functionality.

# What did I use to make it?
Front end: HTML, CSS (Personal CSS framework), and JS

Server: NodeJS
